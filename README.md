# Deep-Learning-Approaches-on-Stock-Market-Prediction

A comprehensive study comparing deep learning and traditional machine learning models for NIFTY 50 stock market prediction.

üìä Project Overview
This project explores various machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict stock market trends using the NIFTY 50 dataset. We compare the performance of traditional models (Random Forest, SVM) with advanced deep learning architectures (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, Bi-RNN) for financial time series forecasting.
